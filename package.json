  "description": "This week, we'll build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. You will implement core backend concepts such as asynchronous programming (callbacks, Promises, async/await), middleware, routing, and database integration. We will connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve data. Algorithmic practice will focus on array manipulation and string algorithms to complement backend development challenges. The goal is to build a robust backend service that can handle various HTTP requests and interact with a database.",
